# SpaceBattleHTML
This is a later version of the space battle game.

The intention of this iteration was to have the interactions be through the initial start and then prompts.
The underlying logic of this works, but the prompt lagging behind the other execution was causing problems.  

At this point, it stops after one battle.  But I did get to the point where the prompt response was not null.  
I considered adding a button to attack again, and adding the logic to keep it hidden unless the user chose to attack again.


I'm submitting this version so that I can work on my project, but if I have time, I will update this.
